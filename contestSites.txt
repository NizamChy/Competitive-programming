1. What is competitive programming?
2. Why competitive programming?
3. How we can start competitive programming 
    -> Knowing the question sets
    -> Compiling and Judging 
    -> How does Online judges work?
    -> Name of Online judges
        a. Codeforces: https://codeforces.com
        b. AtCoder: https://atcoder.jp/home
        c. vJudge: https://vjudge.net/
    -> Knowing about programming contests (ICPC, CF, CC etc)
4. Introduction on CF newcomer sheet
5. Solving our first problem 
6. Data types and their uses.
7. When does data overflow happen?
8. Time complexity
9. Why time complexity should be taken care of.
10. Many types of Input and output
11. Basic instruction for upcoming classes 

*** Class Video, Presentation and Training sheet links are attached.


//////////////////////2
1. Simple discussion on Loop
->Three types of loop
->Break, continue
2. Nested loop
3. Time Complexity
4. Problems need to be solve by loop:
-> Problem G
-> More discussion on data overflow
-> Palindrome
-> Prime number in (O(n) and O(sqrt(n))
-> GCD & LCM
-> Summing the Digits of a number
-> Fibonacci
-> Pattern printing
5. Many types of Input and output (test cases)
6. UVa - 256 !
7. Problems from Sheet - 1

*** Class Video and Training sheet links are attached.

Today we discussed about:

● C++ string
● C String and C++ String
○ Input output
○ string size(), length()
● Getline
○ cin.ignore()
● String builtin compare operators
● String concatenation
● ASCII Value
○ Lower case, upper case, number conversion using ASCII.
○ Working with a character count array.
● Substring
● Subsequence
● Palindrome
● String with some built-in functions
○ sort()
○ reverse()
○ swap()
○ substr()

Problems: E, G, J, L, O. //CHECK PDF ON GC
